This is a simple website that lets you monitor vaccine availability using API Setu (https://apisetu.gov.in/)
Note that this app does not book appointments for you. You can do self registration for getting appointment at https://selfregistration.cowin.gov.in/

As per CoWin API guidelines on API Setu, the API Call limit is 100 API calls per 5 Minutes. This means on average you could make 1 API Request every 3 seconds.

For the purpose of this project, I have used only 2 District IDs 
Thane   392
Mumbai  395

You can modify the code using respective district IDs. You can get district IDs using API from API Setu.
